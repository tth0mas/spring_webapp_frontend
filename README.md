A bare bones React / TypeScript web app, connected to a Spring Boot backend. 

The goal of this is to investigate how to efficiently communicate from a frontend to a backend. Also, to learn more about frontend frameworks, as it is completely new to me. 

Initial todos:
- Create login functionality, connect to login controller in backend
- Add a home page as a logged in user - single sign in?

todos:
- Related to my long-term todos in the backend -- to implement message functionality between existing users in the database.
- - How to store messages? Encrypted in a database? In plain text? Hash checksum?
- Search user functionality?
